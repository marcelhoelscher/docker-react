# Tell travis that we need Docker preinstalled.
services:
  - docker

# Before the tests run we need to build our docker image. 
# We tag the build image because otherwise we would have to read out the id of the build file which is not that easy
before_install:
  - docker build -t stovokhor/docker-react -f Dockerfile.dev .

# Commands to be executed in order to run our test suite
script:
  # Run the 'npm run test' command to execute the tests. Travis expects a test suite to shutdown after the run.
  # Then travis will interprete the exit code. An exit code != 0 means: Failure.
  # But that's not the way how the npm tests work: The node test suite stays up all the time and waits for source code
  # changes in order to run the tests again. 
  # In order to solve this, the "-c CI=true" argument is added which forces the tests to only run once.
  - docker run -e CI=true stovokhor/docker-react npm run test
